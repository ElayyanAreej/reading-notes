# Read: 06 - Inheritance and Interfaces

## Lesson: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
 Software objects are often used to ***model the real-world*** objects that you find in everyday life.

**objects**  (instance) ((bundle of related state and behavior)).

**class** (Blue Print /Model)

**Inheritance** 
classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses.
* **superclass/base/parent** The class from which the subclass is derived. 
* **subclas/derived/extended/child** A class that is derived from another class.

Note: 
every class has one and only one direct superclass.

**interface** is a contract between a class and the outside world. 

**Package**
A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.
