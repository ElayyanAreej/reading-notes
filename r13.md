### The HTTP specification defines many **status codes** we can use when responding to our clients.

Status Classes
If we understand the class a status code is in, we can locate problems more quickly.

* 100 - 199

These are informational status codes; they usually tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. Like using a different protocol or telling the client that its request will fail before they start sending the body.

* 200 - 299

These are the success codes. They tell the client that its request was accepted. In case of asynchronous processing of a request (202), this doesn’t mean the request was successfully processed only that it met all validation requirements at the time of sending.

* 300 - 399

These are redirection codes. They tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore. This can have multiple reasons, be temporary or permanent, but the client has to issue a request to the new location.

* 400 - 499

These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server. There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, etc. A client is sending incorrect input and should confirm the input parameters are correct before retrying the request.

* 500 - 599

These are the server error codes. Often they indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes they can be directly related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server. These errors can be temporary or permanent. Usually it’s best for the client to retry the same request.

* Custom Classes

Custom classes, that is, classes above 599 aren’t permitted but used by some services anyway. For API designers, they are relevant as bad examples. API client creators, however, have to deal with them.

### CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
The CRUD model defines the most basic API actions for persistent storage. Create, read, update, and delete. They make up the lions-share of API endpoints. Let’s see which status codes meet their requirements.

### Errors
* 500 and 404 status codes by default when something went wrong

* 500 means Internal Server Error.

* 404 means Not Found. T
