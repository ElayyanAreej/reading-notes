## The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary

### What is the call stack?

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
Unlimited calls for example a recursive function (a function that calls itself) which will causes a stack overflow.

### What does LIFO mean?
LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.
### What causes a Stack Overflow?
Recursive Function

## JavaScript error messages && debugging

### What is a ‘refrence error’?

The ReferenceError object represents an error when a non-existent variable is referenced.

### What is a ‘syntax error’?
This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

### What is a ‘range error’?
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

### What is a ‘type error’?
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
### What is a breakpoint?
Breakpoints are one of the most important debugging techniques in your developer's toolbox. You set breakpoints wherever you want to pause debugger execution.
### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
To make a breakpoint, putting a **debugger** statement in your code in the line you want to break.
