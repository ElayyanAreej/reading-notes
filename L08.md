# Read: 08 - OO Design
* **"Don't repeat yourself"** is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.

* Duplication is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain.

the cost of maintenance certainly outweighs the cost of refactoring and potential bad design when there are three copies, and may or may not if there are only two copies.

* **You aren't gonna need it** principle of extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.

* A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.
