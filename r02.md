## React: Component Lifecycle Events


React lets you define *components* as **classes** or **functions**.

The *methods* that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events.

 These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

 ### **3** phases of the component **lifecycle**.


* **Mounting**
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. 

* **Updating**
Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.


* **Unmounting**
The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM. componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during this phase.
