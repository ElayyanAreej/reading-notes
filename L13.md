## Working with Relationships in Spring Data REST
**how to work with relationships between entities in Spring Data REST.?**

* **One-to-One Relationship**

two entity classes having a one-to-one relationship
```
@OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")

```

    

 ```
       @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
  ```

We must be careful to have different names for each association resource. 

* **One-to-Many Relationship**

is defined using the @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations
```   
@ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="library_id")
```
   ```
       @OneToMany(mappedBy = "library")

```
* **Many-to-Many Relationship**

is defined using @ManyToMany annotation,to which we can add @RestResource.

## Integration Testing in Spring
* we'll need the latest junit-jupiter-engine, junit-jupiter-api, and Spring test dependencies:

* Enable Spring in Tests with JUnit 5
