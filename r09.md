# Functional Programming Concepts
## What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 
## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
Definition of purity:
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
* It does not cause any observable side effects
# What are the benefits of a pure function?
The code’s definitely easier to test.
# What is immutability?
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
# What is Referential transparency?
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

# Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()
## What is a module?
Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.
# What does the word ‘require’ do?
require() is a function to import 
```
var module = require('module_name');
```
As per above syntax, specify the module name in the require() function. The require() function will return an object, function, property or any other JavaScript type, depending on  what the specified module returns.

# How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
module.exports

# What do we have to do to make a module available?
The module.exports is a special object which is included in every JavaScript file in the Node.js application by default. The module is a variable that represents the current module, and exports is an object that will be exposed as a module. So, whatever you assign to module.exports will be exposed as a module.and then you can import it.
