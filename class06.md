## Why ?

Try to put together a jigsaw puzzle that didn’t have any picture on it !!! The reason why puzzles like this one are so hard, is because you **can’t** really **see what you are trying to build** very clearly.

The **same** thing happens when **writing code**.  Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.


You could spent days trying to implement a feature but if you go back and talk to a product owner and hash out completely how something should work and why it should work in a particular way, only to go back to your desk and crank out the code in a matter of hours.

***It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.***

## What can you do about it?
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

1. Make the problem domain easier.
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain.


***You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.***

## WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
