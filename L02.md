## Packages and Import

### Package
**Package**: grouped classes togarher(collection of related classes).
**package name** is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the (.java) files.
**Package declaration** is a must so you can have import statements, which allow you to specify classes from other packages that can be referenced without qualifying them with their package.

Note:
* Package statement must be first statement in the program even before the import statement.

### Import
To import java package into a class, we need to use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program.

There are 3 different ways to refer to any class that is present in a different package:

1. without import the package
2. import package with specified class
3. import package with all classes


## Java Loops
**loop** the execution of a set of instructions for multiple times or regarding to a condition.
