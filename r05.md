# Readings: Putting it all together
## Thinking in React
### Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. 
 Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. 

One such **technique** is the 1Ô∏è‚É£ single 1Ô∏è‚É£ responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.


### Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity.

üëâ
building a **static version** requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding **interactivity** requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.


### Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with **state**.

Think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. üîë The key here is DRY: Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself.


Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn‚Äôt ~~state~~.
Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn‚Äôt ~~state~~.
Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn‚Äôt state.
The original list of products is passed in as props, so that‚Äôs not ~~state~~.

### Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
We need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.


Remember: ***React*** is all about **one-way data flow** down the component hierarchy. 

#### So follow these steps to figure it out:

For each piece of state in your application:

* Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
* Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
* Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
* If you can‚Äôt find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

### Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
Now it‚Äôs time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in.


Let‚Äôs think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. 
components should only update their own state.  We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. Also The callbacks passed will call setState(), and the app will be updated.
