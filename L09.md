proceed on the understanding this request is being made by a browser.

Now that the browser has the intended hostname for the request, it needs to resolve an IP address1. The browser will then look through its own cache of recently requested URLs, the operating system’s cache of recent queries, your router’s cache, and your DNS cache.

## way of performing HTTP requests in Java — by using the built-in Java class HttpUrlConnection. 

* The HttpUrlConnection class allows us to perform basic HTTP requests without the use of any additional libraries. 

* We can create an HttpUrlConnection instance using the openConnection() method of the URL class. Note that this method only creates a connection object but doesn't establish the connection yet.

* If we want to add parameters to a request, we have to set the doOutput property to true, then write a String of the form param1=value¶m2=value to the OutputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance:

* To execute the request, we can use the getResponseCode(), connect(), getInputStream() or getOutputStream() methods:
