# Readings: React and Forms
## Forms
form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called **“controlled components”**.

### Controlled Components
With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

## JavaScript — The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
Shorten your if statements into one line of code with the conditional operator.
```
if ( condition ) {
  value if true;
} else {
  value if false;
}
```

**Same As**
```
condition ? value if true : value if false
```

### Here’s what you need to know:
1. The condition is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.
2. A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.
3. Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.

We can nest ternary operators to test **multiple conditions**.

Example:
```
let isStudent = false;
let isSenior = true;
let price = isStudent ? 8 : isSenior ? 6 : 10
console.log(price);
// 6
```
