### Why?
* Ensure component reusability.
* Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
* Increased reliability 

### What is a Component?

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

#### Views of a Component
1. object-oriented view.
2. conventional view.
3. process-related view.

#### Characteristics of Components
* Reusability.
* Replaceable.
* Not context specific.
* Extensible.
* Encapsulated.
* Independent.

#### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
* Ease of deployment.
* Reduced cost.
* Ease of development.
* Reusable.
* Modification of technical complexity.
* Reliability.
* System maintenance and evolution.
* Independent.
