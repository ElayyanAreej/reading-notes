### Why?
* Ensure component reusability.
* Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
* Increased reliability 

### What is a Component?

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

#### Views of a Component
1. object-oriented view.
2. conventional view.
3. process-related view.

#### Characteristics of Components
* Reusability.
* Replaceable.
* Not context specific.
* Extensible.
* Encapsulated.
* Independent.

#### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
* Ease of deployment.
* Reduced cost.
* Ease of development.
* Reusable.
* Modification of technical complexity.
* Reliability.
* System maintenance and evolution.
* Independent.

## Props and How to Use it in React
***React*** is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces.

***Prop*** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.


ðŸ‘‰
*Notes* :

-data with props are being passed in a **uni-directional flow.** (one way from parent to child)

-props data is **read-only**, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.


### How are props used in React?
1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child 
3. component(s) by using Props
Finally, render the Props Data
