# Read: Linked Lists

## Linked Lists
one of the data structures that storage the data as nodes in squence 
* Singly linked list 
A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference
it's saves the data and a reference to the **next** one.

* Doubly linked list
refers to there being two references
it's saves the data and a reference to the **next** one and the **Previous** node.

## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. 

* Running Time (time complexity)
The amount of time a function needs to complete.

* Memory Space (space complexity)
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

#### Sources of Memory Usage during function run-time:
* space needed to hold the code for the algorithm.

* space needed to hold the input data.

* space needed for the output data.

* space needed to hold working space during the calculation.
