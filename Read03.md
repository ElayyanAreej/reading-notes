![icon](https://boagworld.sirv.com/Images/Blog-Images/1_6bU5NjDXV9VKQqdel1fx8A.jpg?profile=small%20.png)

is a practice used by *UX designers* which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
* Where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code.
* Getting to know how a user interacts with your interface.
* plan the layout and interaction of your interface.

### Types of Wireframes
* Draw by hand.
* Using software like Invision, or Balsamiq to create theirs.

### How to make your wireframe in six steps
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for quick reference.
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.
5. Add some detail and get testing.
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes


# HTML 
Markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements.

Contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

#### Terminologies
***Nesting elements***
You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting.

***Empty elements***
Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. 

#### Anatomy of an HTML document
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
  </body>
</html>
```

# Semantics
In programming, Semantics refers to ***the meaning of a piece of code*** — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?"


### Semantics in HTML
Semantic element which gives the text it *wraps around the role (or meaning)*. 

#### Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup:

* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO).
* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes.
* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.
* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.


#### Semantic elements
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:
```
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
```
