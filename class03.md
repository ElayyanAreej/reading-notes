## HTML Lists 
HTML provides us with three different types:
* **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
The ordered list is created with the ``` <ol> ``` element.
Each item in the list is placed between ``` <li> ``` tags.

* **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
The unordered list is created with the ``` <ul> ``` element.
Each item in the list is placed between ``` <li> ``` tags.

* **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

ðŸ‘‰
*Note* 

You can put a second list inside an  ``` <li> ``` element to create a sublist or *nested list*.

## Boxes 
CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
![box](https://www.unm.edu/~tbeach/IT145/week08/images/boxmodel.gif)
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents.
You can set your own dimensions for a box by the **height** and **width** properties.

Example:
```
p {
height: 300px;
width: 75%;
}
```

ðŸ‘‰
*Note* 

Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen.
So you can use **min-width** property to specifie the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browserwindow is narrow, and the **max-width**  to indicate the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide. In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box
on a page.

```
#id {
min-width: 450px;
max-height: 30px;
}
```

Every box has three available properties:
1. ***Broder*** 
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible).
2. ***Margin*** Sit outside the edge of the border.
3. ***Padding*** Is the space between the border of a box and any
content contained within it.


ðŸ‘‰
*Note* 

The **border-width** property is used to control the width of a border and
The **border-style** allows you to specify style of it, and the **border-color** to specify the color. 

```
p {
border: 3px dotted #0088dd; }
```
### How to center content?
the element that the box sits inside should have a **text-align**property with its value set to *center*. 


### What Is **display** property?

The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.

* **inline**
This causes a block-level element to act like an inline element.
* **block**
This causes an inline element to act like a block-level element.
* **inline-block**
This causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element, while retaining other features of a block-level element.

### What Is **visibility** property?
The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been.

## JavaScript
### ARRAYS 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

ðŸ‘‰
*Note* 

-You do not need to specify how many values it will hold. 

-The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. 

-Values in an array are accessed as if they are ina numbered list.starts at zero (not one). whiches called an *index*.

-Each array has a property called *length*, which holds the number of items in the array. **arryName.length;** 

![arr](https://csharpcorner-mindcrackerinc.netdna-ssl.com/article/array-destructuring-in-javascript/Images/Array%20Destructuring%20In%20JavaScript.png)


-array created using a different technique called an **array constructor**. This uses the new keyword followed by Array();
```
var colors=new Array('white ' ,
'black',
'custom'); 
```

* **do while**
Very similar to the while loop, but  it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once.
