## HTML Lists 
HTML provides us with three different types:
* **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
The ordered list is created with the ``` <ol> ``` element.
Each item in the list is placed between ``` <li> ``` tags.

* **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
The unordered list is created with the ``` <ul> ``` element.
Each item in the list is placed between ``` <li> ``` tags.

* **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

*Note* 

You can put a second list inside an  ``` <li> ``` element to create a sublist or *nested list*.
