## How People Access the Web
* **Browsers**
People access websites using
software called a web browser.

* **Web Servers** 
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.

* **Devices**
People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices.

* **Screen readers**
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user.

## How Websites Are Created
![icon](https://hostpapa.blog/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/websitebuilder.jpg)
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## HTML 
HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.

*Note* Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML.

### Comments in HTML

```
<!-- comment goes here -->
```

### ID Attribute
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element.
```
<p id="pullquote">
```

### Class Attribute
Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements.

### Block Elements
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are known as block level elements>

### Inline Elements
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as
inline elements.

### Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
Elements allows you to group a set of elements together.

* div

``` <div> ``` set of elements togetherin one block-level box.

* span
``` <span> ``` contain a number of inline elements.

#### iframe 
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page and in that window you can see another page.

### New Html5 Layout
Elements
***HTML5*** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them.

Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as inline elements.

*Notes*

-Every website should be designed for the target audience not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your **target audience** is.

-**WireFrames** e is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require. **[Read more](Read03.md)**

## JavaScript
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

1. DEFINE THE GOAL
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3. CODE EACH STEP 

### OBJECTS & PROPERTIES 
each physical thing in the world can be represented as an **object**.

Each object can have its own:
* **Properties**  the characteristics of an object.

*  **Events**
An event is the computer's way of sticking up its
hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!" 

* **Methods** contain lots of instructions that together represent one task.


### HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER 

#### It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies !
 üòÖ üç∞


1. ***HTML*** is the markup language that we use to structure 
2. ***CSS*** is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content.
3. ***JavaScript*** is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content. 


üëâ 
*Notes* 

When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML
```<script>``` element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.
