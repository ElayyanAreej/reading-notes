# Passing Functions as Props
## Lists and Keys
### Lists
You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

Example
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```

When you run this code, you’ll be given a warning that a **key** should be provided for list items.

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don’t need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays

### Key
 A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.

```
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  ```

  ## Spread Operator
  In JavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.


#### Spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following:
* Copying an array
* Concatenating or combining arrays
* Using Math functions
* Using an array as arguments
* Adding an item to a list
* Adding to state in React
* Combining objects
* Converting NodeList to an array
