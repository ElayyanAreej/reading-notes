## Spring Boot and OAuth2 
How to build a sample app doing various things with "social login" using OAuth 2.0 and Spring Boot.

* starts with a simple, single-provider single-sign on, and works up to a client with a choice of authentication providers: GitHub or Google.



- click: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.

- logout: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.

- two-providers: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.

- custom-error: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.

The apps all work on localhost:8080 because they’ll use OAuth 2.0 clients registered with GitHub and Google for that address.
