## RESTful web API design
A well-designed web API should aim to support:

* Platform independence. Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally. 

* Service evolution. The web API should be able to evolve and add functionality independently from client applications. 

## REST
![REST](https://nitrocdn.com/GuYcnotRkcKfJXshTEEKnCZTOtUwxDnm/assets/static/optimized/rev-2b63acc/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/rest.png)

 is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP.

 A primary advantage of REST over HTTP is that it uses open standards, and does not bind the implementation of the API or the client applications to any specific implementation.

 ### The HTTP protocol defines a number of methods that assign semantic meaning to a request. The common HTTP methods used by most RESTful web APIs are:

* **GET** retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
* **POST** creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.

* **PUT** either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.

* **PATCH** performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.

* **DELETE** removes the resource at the specified URI.
