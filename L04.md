## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
numbers:
* Decimals 
The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

* Binary Numbers
(0,1)

* Hexadecimal Numbers
They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
Java is oop lang "java classes"
where the class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

### Inheritance
derive one class from another (when we have something in common so we use it)
