# Readings: NODE.JS
## What Is Node and When Should I Use It?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

And this is what Stack Overflow has to offer:

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
((Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.))

They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.
## Pair Programming
![pp](https://www.mitrais.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/img-pair-programming.jpg)
pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. 

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

### How ?
 Involves two roles: 
 1. **The Driver** : is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
 2. **The Navigator** : uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 

### Why ?

 There are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:
 * Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary.
 * Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea.
 * Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey.
 * Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

 So *Pair programming* touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
